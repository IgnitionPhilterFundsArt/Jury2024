            <h1>7 - Ring In The Year Of The Dragon</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>OVERVIEW: I am writing to submit a proposal for an art grant to fund the creation of a high-striker (“ring the bell”) carnival game that will also be a functional flame effect. This project aims to combine artistic expression with interactive elements to engage and inspire Flipizens. 
The installation combines all elements of the theme for the 2024 event, Cosmic Critter Carnival. The aesthetic elements of the piece interpret Cosmic Critter through the Chinese zodiac. In the Chinese lunar new year, 2024 has transitioned into the year of the dragon. The installation will challenge burners to test their strength in traditional carnival fashion.
ARTISTIC VISION: The installation seeks to encapsulate the celebratory aspects of both Eastern lunar new year festivals and Western carnival atmosphere. The 2-dimensional representation of the pagoda and dragon will be detailed to mimic the beautiful intricacy of Chinese architecture and art, while the lighting and interactive elements will draw participants in with fun-loving carnival energy. Participants will use a mallet to slam down on a lever, launching a striker mechanism, attempting to reach and ring the gong that adorns the top of the tower. Each roof section of the pagoda will be marked by other zodiac animals and will illuminate if the striker passes them. Upon reaching the top, the striker will not only ring the gong, but evoke a fireball to burst upward from the mouth of the dragon.

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>This ancient tower celebrates the Chinese zodiac and features many of those celestial critters in an interactive game that will test your strength with a traditional carnival challenge. Will you be able to awaken the dragon?</p>

            <h3>Application Art</h3>
            <p><a href="./art/app-7-1.pdf" target="_blank" >app-7-1.pdf</a></p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>I hope to place the installation in the Fire Garden camp. If no power is available I can modify the piece to operate on battery.</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>A fire extinguisher will be present at the installation and it will only be operated when burners familiar with flame effects and fire safety are present. </p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>I have already completed detailed plans regarding most aspects of construction. I plan to work with several other burners to complete and test the installation by May 12th. I plan to arrive on the first day burn opens to begin setup and begin tear down after the main burn. </p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I make costumes, props and larger projects that my friends often describe as “extra.” For [a] Hobbit themed [event] I made a transportable 11 foot bar (with functional taps) enclosed in a tavern modeled after the Green Dragon Inn. At Flipside ‘23 I constructed the sign for Procrastination Station, and at Burnt Soup that year I embodied the spirit of the burn by dressing up in a 4ft can that pooped actual cans containing various pieces of art. </p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>575</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>575</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>If budget requires me to scale back my vision I could either eliminate the flame effect entirely, or scale much of the 2D elements down. </p>
