            <h1>8 - Love & Light</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>"Love & Light" is an experimental art installation that invites you to immerse yourself in a radiant world of connection, community, and remembrance. It will feature a stunning chandelier crafted from resin poured sun catchers illuminated by dynamic, sound-reactive LED lights.
As you step into the space surrounding "Love & Light," you'll immediately be drawn to the mesmerizing interplay of colors and shapes dancing across the forest. Each sun catcher, meticulously crafted in a variety of shapes and hues, captures and refracts light in a unique manner, creating an ever-shifting kaleidoscope of life.
But "Love & Light" is more than just a visually striking installation"it's a testament to the power of unity and diversity. Throughout the creation process of "Love & Light," the community will be actively engaged and invited to participate by submitting pictures of their own handwritten messages bearing the simple yet profound phrase "Love, [name]" which will be embedded within each resin panel. This collaborative effort serves as a powerful reflection of the community's collective love, creating something that couldn't exist without the intention and participation of the entire community. Moreover, by contributing their handwritten expressions of affection, individuals will play a vital role in infusing the exhibit with genuine warmth and authenticity, as handwriting is tantamount to a fingerprint -- a unique and deeply personal aspect of each individual. Through this inclusive approach, "Love & Light" becomes not only a work of art but also a symbol of the community spirit that fosters a sense of belonging for all who encounter it.
In a touching gesture of remembrance, the community will also be encouraged to submit pictures of handwriting samples from their loved ones who have passed. These cherished memories will be carefully preserved within resin panels, their presence serving as a poignant reminder of the enduring bonds that connect us to those we hold dear. In this way, "Love & Light" becomes a sanctuary where the spirits of the departed live on, their essence intermingling with the collective love and light of the living.
At its core, this exhibit is a celebration of the beauty that arises when we embrace our differences and come together in a spirit of love and acceptance. Just as the diverse array of sun catchers coalesce to form a radiant rainbow, so too do we, as individuals, contribute to the vibrant mosaic of humanity. "Love & Light" invites you to bask in the warmth of that shared light, to reflect on the love that surrounds us, and to honor the memories of those that continue to illuminate our lives.
The creation of over 300 resin suncatchers, along with the assembly of the approximately 3x3x3ft chandelier structure and implementation of the LED lighting system, represents a significant undertaking that requires careful planning and resources. However, with the support of this grant, I am confident that "Love & Light" can become a reality, offering a transformative experience for audiences to immerse themselves in a world of love, connection, and shared light.

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>I am still unsure about my preferences for whether "Love & Light" would be best showcased within/nearby a theme camp or as a standalone exhibit out on the Pecan Playa. However, I have a generator so this would give me flexibility to position the installation on art island, the effigy grounds, etc.</p>

            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>While I have not completed any large-scale projects solely out of resin, I am familiar with the media and have worked with it before. Additionally, I am accustomed to planning and adjusting course during the creation of large-scale art projects. Last year, for example, I fabricated and painted several pieces of Playatech flat-pack furniture, including a bar that is as much art as it is function. I spent 50+ hours designing a mural, hand painting each panel, and layering on blacklight and iridescent foil details before coating the entire project in polyurethane. Through the process, I gained valuable insights into the importance of meticulous planning, budgeting extra time, and overestimating the duration of each step. Despite the logistical challenges, I successfully brought the project to fruition in [out of state] before transporting it to Austin for its debut at Flipside last year. </p>
