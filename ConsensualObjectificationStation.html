            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>A mobile interactive experience that allows people to compliment friends and strangers in a familiar but socially discouraged way- by objectifying them! Objectification is normally viewed as dehumanizing since it focuses on one small part of a person at a time, but this art piece seeks to reclaim this experience and allow the objectifier and objectified to connect by allowing the objectification to be viewed as a compliment. This art piece will consist of a pedestal for the consenting human to stand upon to be objectified, a lemonade stand-like structure for the main objectifier to present themselves in (especially handy for when the piece is set up in one location so passers-by can participate), a lit marquee-style arrow to point at the objectified human (which is attached to a wagon so we can easily move the art piece around the city), and a spotlight and megaphone to heighten the objectification experience for those near and far. </p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>Our planning portion of this project is nearly complete, since we have the overall structure and design thought through. We plan to construct most of the art piece in one of the creatorï¿½s shop spaces. Since the piece is mobile, installment is not a concern. It does not have small detachable pieces, nor will it be decorated with any materials that would leave MOOP around our fair city.</p>
