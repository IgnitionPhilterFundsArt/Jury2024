            <h1>32 - Aesch Hazzan</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>Aesch Hazzan is a metal sculpture flame effect intended to convey the illusion of flight using directed high pressure bursts of propane. The central figure will be a dragonfly constructed from electrical metal tubing, copper tubing, steel square stock, and rebar. It will be decorated with high carbon steel scale mail and steel plates to mimic the skin of a fire-breathing dragon. The mouthparts, tail, and outline of two discrete sets of wings will be consistently lit by the pilot portion of the plumbing design. When participants interact with a button actuation game to solve a puzzle, the system will release a burst of high pressure to force the wings downward. The dragonfly will be balanced atop a water lily resting on a lily pad, both fabricated with sheet steel of sufficient thickness to support the weight without deforming. The electrical actuation game will be situated within a stand of wetland plants made of pex and various types of scrap metal located at least 15 feet away from the flame effect. To ensure safety, the team will construct the plumbing system using water-oil-gas rated black iron, copper and brass pipe and fittings. The design includes multiple pressure flow safety valves as well as an emergency stop to disable ignition. </p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>Aesch Hazzan is a metal sculpture flame effect intended to convey the illusion of flight using directed high pressure bursts of propane. Play a game, solve a puzzle, help a critter land in a lovely spot for a bit of rest. </p>

            <h3>Application Art</h3>
            <p><a href="./art/app-32-1.pdf" target="_blank" >app-32-1.pdf</a></p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>We will use one of our personal Honda 2K generators. </p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>This piece incorporates flame effects, but it is not designed to burn. Any time during which the art is operational, one of us will be on site to monitor for leaks from the fuel depot feed or any other unsafe condition. There has been some talk in fire garden chats to share monitor shifts amongst other flame effects projects. If this is the case, we will make sure anyone on watch duty knows how to turn off the feed of fuel to the effect, disengage the ignition circuit, and bleed the lines of any remaining propane vapor. </p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>We've completed our concept sketches, so the next step is to purchase materials and begin shaping metal to form the dragonfly. The three of us are also volunteering with DaFT, so we will likely be working a few hours per week during build nights throughout March, April and May. Once we have the shape we want for the dragonfly, we'll be able to start figuring out the proper measurements for threaded gas-tight black iron pipes and hoses. The water lily, lily pad, and whatever bracing stand we build for those will be the final sculptural elements to be assembled. We will be able to borrow a trailer from someone to load this art piece and bring to the event. Unloading and installation should take 4-6 hours on site. We will also borrow a trailer to bring the project back after the event. </p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>Yes, we have all volunteered in leadership roles for Flipside and Freezerburn effigies. [Artist 1] was DaFT lead in 2022, and [Artist 2] was one of the lieutenants that year, along with his years of experience working on various Burning Man builds. [Artist 3] has been the lead for flame effects team on many of the recent FS and FZB effigy crews. [Artist 1,2 &3] also designed and built one of the 2023 art grants- Cloudseeder. We have worked on many different projects together at this point. We understand each other's strengths, weaknesses and rhythms quite well, and continue to learn better and more efficient ways to put our skillsets together for optimum effect.</p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>$1,000</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>For the normal grant value of $575, we would be able to make a version of this project that probably involves no movement, but might be aesthetically pleasing. </p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>We would try to source more found materials to save costs, but most likely a smaller budget would mean fewer expensive parts that we hope will allow the wings to move without deforming. This is fine. We can build this as a static art piece, but it would be more exciting and challenging for us to figure out how to make the fire mechanically move parts of the structure. </p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Amount</h3>
            <p>575</p>
        
            <h3>Previous Funding</h3>
            <p>No, we have not received funding for this piece. </p>
