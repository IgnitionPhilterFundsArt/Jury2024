            <h1>37 - 3am Eats</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>"3am Eats purpose is creating and serving Eats to on-duty volunteers and the general population that is awake at 3am on the Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday mornings. 

Meals* to include: Chili w/ Firehouse Mash Taters, Grilled Cheese Sandwiches, Cheeseburgers, Chicken Noodle Soup with rolls.

* Meals may change depending on funding, ease of meal, assistance, and availability
of available food stock at the stores - it will all be tried and tested good.

I work the graveyard shift at UT and camp with Wally (Cast Iron Village at FZBN, and Cowboys & Hippies at FlipSide), and will be staying up all night until 8am (my usual bedtime) to keep my body on my 'normal' sleep / awake cycle. 

At FRBN 2024, I did 3am Chili with Firehouse Mash Taters (I’m an old retired firefighter), and we served about 45-60 people and it was a huge success, and I’d like to expand this to creating and serving each night (early morning) at FlipSide."</p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>"3am Eats - Serving Eats at 3am Burner Time at Cowboys & Hippies (also know as Wally’s Cast Iron Kitchen) for volunteers, night owls, cowboys, hippies and everyone who may be up at 3am and needs some sustenance.

* On Duty Volunteers GET Front of the LINE Service  - this is my way of thanking them for making FlipSide happen.

* * Bring your own bowl, cup, spoon etc….   aka: radical self-reliance."</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>I have all the infrastructure we need to cook and serve.</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>I will have a fire extinguisher in the kitchen.</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>Eats will be cooked in the kitchen. Kitchen will be cleaned up at the end of each meal. Participants will provide their own bowl, cup, spoon, hands and are responsible for not making moop and cleaning their own eating items and hands.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>Created 3am Eats for FZBN 2024 and served 3am Chili with Firehouse Mash Tators with shredded cheese and rolls. 

We served about 60 people in about 25 minutes, prep and cook time took about 1.5 hours. 

Think it went great, we got lots of smiles, positive reviews & thanks, and fed a lot of hungry stomachs. 

Sorry no pictures - was focused on immediacy. </p>

            <p>Will cover cost of the gifts myself, though reduced funds may limit the number of meals served at 3am.
