            <h1>31 - Noh Me, Know Mu</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>"Step into the ethereal realm of Noh Me, Know Mu at Burning Flipside, where the essence of creation thrives in the absence of creators. An esoterically artistic space, whose existential emptiness lures the effusive or indifferent artists and artisans to silence its vacuous echo with their ethereal tapestry of emancipated artistic expression and communal spirit. 

Noh theater will consist of a 12x20 structure decorated in a way befitting of the nothingness, featuring 2 skeletal horses (from my rocking horse sculptures). The space will have lights and sound (amplified, but we're not a dance camp, tho I can't promise there won't be dancing), and a bar. Our camp will host a couple of happy hour events* and a dance workshop in the space, but outside of that Noh will serve as an open invitation community event space. We will promote the space in the months before Flipside, create a calendar of events, and publish it. 

* Some possible camp hosted events:
1. How to Suck Less Happy Hour, where we might serve adult Capri Suns
2. Old Timers Lawn Hang, where we will invite all the old school Flipizens to sit on the lawn and yell at young'uns to """"get off our lawn"""" while we drink iced coffee and discuss how it's just not as good as it used be.

. . . . more to come . . . ."</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>We will power the theater and our camp on 1 generator</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Maybe</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>It is interactive in that it is a space for people to gather and frolic</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>Collect materials, pack materials, spend too much time worrying about having all the materials, get it to Flipside, put the materials up. Enjoy the materials. Take materials down and spend too much time not unpacking the materials, then spend time worrying about if we have all the materials.  Seriously, art is ready to go.  Playa tech bar and shelf will be easy to make once we have funds for the wood.  We have lights and sound. </p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I created the Four Rocking Horses of the Apocalypse, a large scale wood sculpture series that has been shared with the community many times. [Provided website which revealed identity.]</p>
