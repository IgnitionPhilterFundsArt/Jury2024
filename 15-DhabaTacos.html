            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p> My other half and I have brought Dhaba Tacos to Flipside since 2018. It has grown each year and turned into an interactive food experience. Food is a vital part of every person's life but so many people are disconnected from their food and the people who prepare it. Dhaba Tacos is a project that strives to connect people to each other and their food through a shared culinary experience. We teach people how to make naan and some of the cultural history behind the food that goes with the naan. Of course we make people wash their hands first.
 This project received funding at both Flipside and Freezer Burn multiple years in a row. Last year at Flipside and this year at Freezer burn we had an ambitious schedule and served many people.  This year Dhaba Tacos is scaling back a bit. We plan to serve 150 to 165 participants Thursday evening and 30 participants for early breakfast Friday morning.
 I strive to create opportunities for those wishing to engage in art but are not planners or have the ability to bring art themselves. Growing our food art experience from one event into two increases the opportunities for others to participate. Sourcing help from people outside our immediate campmates lowers the stress level of the project. We hope this model will help guide people to think of art and participation in different ways.

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>A Dhaba is a roadside stand in India. Initially, they served mostly weary travelers, like truck drivers, good comfort food and masala chia tea on the cheap. Eventually, this street food evolved into some of the best and most unique cuisine India has to offer. Here at The Dhaba we recreate this unique Indian truck stop culinary experience for you, complete with rats and all.
But wait there is more…..we are the cheapest dhaba in existence, but in order to keep our low low prices ($0), and save on labor, you must make your own food. Don’t worry, we will teach you (also for free)! So remember, wash your hands you dirty hippies, and get to work rolling your own delicious naan and samosa.
Open Thursday night for late dinner and Friday morning for early breakfast.

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>I prepare most of the food before arriving on the land. Usually I start cooking a month or more before a festival and prepare the food in 3 or 4 installments. The art is eaten and we clean up what is left in our camp kitchen.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I have brought a version of Dhaba Tacos to Flipside since 2018. I have experimented with serving different numbers of people and different menu items. I have always achieved the goals of my art project. I have confidence in my ability to successfully complete the 2024 version of Dhaba Tacos. </p>
