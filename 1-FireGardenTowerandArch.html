            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>My grant request is for propane and trailer rental to bring out my 18' metal fire tower flame effect and a 15' arch to serve as the 'gate' into the Fire Garden where burners can check out the effects.  The Fire Garden Tower is a structure that has a 1.25" valved flame effect fed by 2 100lb high pressure propane sources into 2 30 gal. accumulators.  The vent at the top shoots the flame into a horizontal 5' diameter flat plate so that the flame blossoms out into a disc at 18' in the air.  There's an additional mystery component I'm experimenting with that will add extra colored flames (if it works.)  The Fire Tower has a remote 'big red button' on a stand so that folks can fire it off from a safe distance.</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>** not provided **</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>The Fire Tower has a remote switch stand so that viewers do not need to approach within 15' of the effect.  The effect controller (at the base of the tower,) has a key lock, an emergency cutoff and is contained in a closable and lockable case.  The effect has 1/4 shutoff valves at multiple stages allowing quick cutoff of vapor. A 10' exclusion ring around the effect is designated with safety tape.  The effect controller is removed from the effect when not in use.  The effect has been constructed to NFPA-160 standards and would pass a State or local Fire Marshal inspection if this were a permitted event.</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>In Progress (Making Changes)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>The Fire Tower sets up and tears down in approx 90 miuntes with 2 people.  It does not generate MOOP.  We will police the area at GTFO.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>Yes.  OCT was my flame effect project last year.  I also spent 5 years as the Flame and Safety Officer for Maker Faire Austin setting up and running flame effects.  [The artist provided two websites showing multiple fire projects detailing prior large projects with video, etc.but the information revealed who they are]</p>
