            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>The Whirl is the 11-foot diameter merry-go-round, the central component of the Whirl of Art installation. It is built to evoke pure, childlike joy in participants of all ages who get to ride this recreation from times long gone.
Crafting an 11-foot diameter merry-go-round sturdy enough to endure the weight and movement of numerous adults within the confines of a burn landscape presents a myriad of challenges demanding meticulous planning and construction. It is constructed using a 5-ft diameter steel core with wooden extensions on upside down wheels. Central handlebars and outer edge handlebars help participants stay on when it spins. An off-center 10 ft pole is connected to surrounding art installations transferring the motion of the merry-go-round to different components, bringing them to life. As people ride The Whirl, the bat flaps its" wings (Norturtan Reverie project), Earth-seed opens and closes (TerRa Luna project), hands play the guitar (Capital Chord project), bells ring (Alma de Familia project) and the turtle swims atop a wave (Turtle Tower project).
This marvel is designed not merely as a fun functional element but as a canvas for artistic expression. The center is a colorful abstract representation of "whirl of art" concept. The submerging of colors together creates a still visual representation of movement through a smooth blending of colors. The outer edges of the merry-go-round are set to undergo a transformation akin to the style found in the mesmerizing animations seen on Bonobo's record covers: a series of pictures showing sequential phases of the animation, infusing it with a vibrant tapestry of images representative of each art tower. When the merry-go-round spins these minimal differences between images creates a fluent optical illusion of motion. This type of phenakistoscope design was the first widespread animation device and is regarded as one of the first forms of moving media entertainment that paved the way for the future motion picture and film.
Our merry-go-round rendition The Whirl will harmonize the essence of each towering masterpiece while fostering a sense of whimsy and wonderment among those who engage with it.</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>All lights used for this installation are solar or battery powered, eliminating the need for a generator.</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
            <p>This installation does not incorporate flame effects, but it is a ride and people are expected to get on it and make it turn. Handlebars are installed making it easy to hold on and to push. We plan to inspect all components for safety on a daily basis.</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>In Progress (Making Changes)

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>Design has been finalized. The build has been completed. All wooden pieces were pre-cut, sanded and primed, labeled and checked to ensure they fit together. The merry-go-round structure has been to Myschievia and Freezerburn, where it performed very well. We still need to make minor adjustments, weld the custom pole top and add lights. It is currently being painted with a unique design to accentuate the spinning movement. We expect to need 2 build days on the land for it to be built and then connected to surrounding 5 art installations. We expect to need only 4 hours to carefully disassemble and transport off the property. Project will bring moop-buckets and moop-sticks to be used for daily de-mooping, as well as for post event cleanup.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>There are three key artists/builders involved in creating The Whirl. One has brought art projects to burns that required building as well as artistic designs (�Rejuvenation Chambers� Freezerburn & Flipside 2018, �Texass Alamo� Engulf 2021, Love Burn & Apogaea 2022). One was an effigy builder (Flipside since 2013, Freezerburn since 2015) and a lead artist/build lead (Freezerburn 2016 & 2018) for Texas regional effigies . One is a visual artist who contributed her talent to projects in the past.</p>
