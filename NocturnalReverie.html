            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>Titled 'Nocturnal Reverie,' this art piece is a 12" wide representation of a majestic bat. With wings outstretched, it embodies the elegance and mystique of these nocturnal creatures, which have become emblematic of the Dallas burner community.  Crafted with meticulous attention to detail, each bat wing will display intricate designs cut into the wood. The wooden surface of the sculpture will be charred and paint-stained purple. The bat's eyes will become a prominent focal point, created using iridescent glass lit from the inside, creating an almost otherworldly glow that makes the creature appear as if it's watching over the playa. At night the bat will bask in the purple lights shining from below, while its outline will be visible from afar. It will sit atop an 8"x8"x9" base. Inside space is to be transformed into a bat cave with UV art by diverse Dallas artists. A unique mobile composed of handcrafted bats created by members of the local community will be the centerpiece of the gallery. Outside, the base will showcase wall art depicting landscapes, plants, and animals of Texas. Each wall is a unique work by individual local artists, with one wall converted to paint-by-numbers to become a true communal creation. Linked to the 11" diameter merry-go-round nearby, 'Nocturnal Reverie' will become a kinetic masterpiece. The bat will flap its wings, mirroring the enchanting flight of real bats, when riders spin, making this an exciting interactive experience. Ultimately, 'Nocturnal Reverie' serves as a reminder of the unity in self-expression, urging a connection with nature amid collective celebrations.</p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>"Nocturnal Reverie" is a representation of a majestic bat. With wings outstretched, it embodies the elegance and mystique of these nocturnal creatures, which have become emblematic of the Dallas burner community.  When standing on the lower field of the Piney Playa on a quiet night, the sight of bats swooping across the effigy field is a peaceful and awe inspiring moment for many Myschievian artists. The bat sits atop a base covered in unique paintings that houses a community UV art gallery stylized as a bat cave. The bat is connected to the nearby giant merry-go-round. When burners hop on the merry-go-round and begin their whimsical ride, the bat sculpture comes to life with rhythmic movements, its wings starting to flap.</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>All lights used for this installation are solar powered, eliminating the need for a generator. </p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
            <p>This installation does not incorporate flame effects and is not climbable, however it contains moving pieces activated by the nearby merry-go-round. All moving parts are at least 9� off the ground and outside people�s reach.</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>Design has been finalized and we are now working on details. The build will commence as soon as we receive funds for materials. All pieces will be pre-cut, sanded and painted as needed, pre-assembled in large sections, and checked to ensure they fit together during the pre-Flipside build. We expect to need 2-3 build days on the land before opening it to visitors. We expect to need 1.5 days to carefully disassemble and transport off the property. Project will bring moop-buckets and moop-sticks to be used for daily de-mooping, as well as for post event cleanup.</p>
