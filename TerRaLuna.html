            <h1>19 - TerRa Luna</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>TerRa Luna is being crafted by a dedicated team from Houston. Inspired by the city's profound ties to space exploration, this ambitious art project seeks to celebrate Houston's historical significance in humanity's ventures beyond our planet.  
At its core, TerRa Luna is a 10-foot tall kinetic, flowering seed sculpture that sits upon a 9-foot tall wooden base and opens as the merry-go-round takes participants for a ride. When the kinetic seed is in its closed state, the focal point is the wind-powered spinning sphere positioned above the seed. The gleaming sphere represents both the sun and moon, with its radiant presence shifting depending on the viewer's perspective. As the seed opens, it reveals an enchanting transformation " the Terran globe at its core is an intricate representation of earth as the Eye of the World blooming in a magnificent fountain of creation, reaching towards the celestial sun and moon, symbolizing the creative forces that flow from our planet to the vast cosmic expanse. This dynamic interplay of elements within the art piece invites us to explore the interwoven relationship between earth, space, and the human spirit.
The wooden pedestal base, aside from being the anchor for the sculpture, serves as a specially curated art gallery inside. The central piece is a 3D handcrafted "Flowing Earth" sculpture, made by one of Houston's very talented artists from steel wire and carefully selected river stones. The communal art piece "Chandelier of Dreams" serves as a canvas for community members to inscribe their personal visions for the future on acrylic pieces, projecting a collective desire to manifest change and enabling many to share their dreams with participants on the playa. These are surrounded by a collection of 2D art pieces showcasing the work of a variety of local Houston artists. The space is designed with a celestial theme, with galaxies and stars projected onto the floor, creating an immersive and otherworldly atmosphere that encourages visitors to gaze around and ponder the mysteries of the great cosmos. Visual art is supplemented by a carefully selected musical compilation playing in the background. 
Outside of the base serves as a canvas for numerous artists to express what Houston means to them: the enormous rural city with a small urban center crisscrossed by the widest freeways in the country, a port and the energy capital, one of the most ethnically and racially diverse cities, and our home of resilience in the face of natural disasters.
 TerRa Luna, as a whole, celebrates community by weaving together the threads of big city life, nature, culture, and the cosmos, encouraging viewers to contemplate their own dreams, the collective wisdom of humanity, and the boundless potential of creative expression in the unspoken language of art.</p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>TerRa Luna, crafted by a dedicated Houston team, pays tribute to the city's space exploration legacy. When closed, a spinning sphere above a giant blooming seed represents the sun and moon. As a merry-go-round spins, the seed opens and closes, revealing Earth as the eye of the world within a fountain of creation reaching up towards space. Inside the base, among the celestial-themed decor, is a curated art gallery which includes a "Flowing Earth" sculpture, a communal burner project called "Chandelier of Dreams," and a collection of works by local artists. TerRa Luna harmonizes nature, culture, and the cosmos, encouraging contemplation of dreams and creative expression.</p>

            <h3>Application Art</h3>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>All lights used for this installation are solar or battery powered, eliminating the need for a generator. </p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
            <p>This installation does not incorporate flame effects and is not climbable, however it contains moving pieces activated by the nearby merry-go-round. All moving parts are at least 9� off the ground and outside people�s reach.
</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>In Progress (Making Changes)

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>Structural design has been finalized. The build has been almost completed. All wooden pieces were pre-cut, sanded, labeled and checked to ensure they fit together. The structure has been to Freezerburn, where it was connected to the merry-go-round. The mechanism that opens and closes the seed performed very well. We still need to make minor adjustments, prime and paint the art piece. The base wall murals and the inside gallery space are being currently designed. Art pieces to be displayed inside are being searched for. The chandelier is being worked on by the local burner community at Church Nights and Thermal Thursdays. The lights, power banks and solar panels will be purchased once we have the funds. We expect to need 2-3 days on the land for it to be assembled and connected to the merry-go-round. We expect to need 1.5 days to carefully disassemble and transport off the property. Project will bring moop-buckets and moop-sticks to be used for daily de-mooping, as well as for post event cleanup.</p>
