            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>This piece will look like a small living room set up in the woods at Flipside. There will be an old school CRT TV connected to a VCR with some items scattered around for it to look inviting. And it will! The purpose is to have a stack of VHS tapes (because how long ago was it that we dealt with magnetic tape medium? Never ever, for some younger burners!) and on those VHS tapes I'm going to have a collection of oddball things on them.

I've been experimenting with transferring modern media onto VHS tapes. I want to do that for a number of different things (cartoons, anime, internet videos, cats being cats, etc) and have them transferred onto VHS and then whoever is playing them in the woods can take a moment to appreciate them.

We've gotten so comfortable with all this available media at our fingertips but I want to make a new-fangled digital post-VHS age retro reminder of our bygone tape-storage roots.

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>We have a 3500 W generator that I'll leave running during the best operating hours.</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>There are some things for this that I would need to buy, but honestly it's reusing a lot of the wood from my project for Flipside 2023 and wouldn't need much in the way of materials. Most everything else can be purchased cheaply.  Ultimately it will be a pack-in-pack-out art piece that will fit in either my car or the back of someone else's truck.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I made $PEEDY BEER EXPRE$$ last year at Flipside 2023 and was funded through the Ignition Philter. That was a mixed bag because I ran into the problems of cat herding (like, I had 12-15 people say they would help staff it before the burn, but my muddled leadership and general unfocused nature of the project as a satire of consumerism drove some would-be participants off and I had to staff it myself for most of the time or it remain closed - and so it did remain closed way more than I would have liked).

That won't be the case here because I thought of this idea last year at Flipside 2023 when I was agonizing over my choices listed in the paragraph above. I decided that my next thing, this piece, would take less construction, be smaller, and require no staff. So here we are!</p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>$575</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>It won't but I might not have the small things like lighting that I wanted. Also I have to buy a few pieces of technology and some editing software (depending on the grant amount will determine how many VHS tapes I'll bring, but regardless they will be curated).</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Amount</h3>
            <p>$200</p>
        
            <h3>Previous Funding</h3>
            <p>No, but I will be reusing materials already paid for by Ignition Philter (tarps, carpet, wood, etc) to save on costs.</p>
