            <h1>9 - Friendly Universal Telecom payphones are back!</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>Pretty sure you all know who FUTelecom is, so I'll just say we've made some big advances in our tech and volunteer edumacations, and we're ready to bring back all 6 payphones and start working on the next!  We found a way to do the batteries that fits in the booth and will last us many burns instead of failing after 3 or 4 years like lead acid batteries tend to.  $200 per booth for the batteries, and a bit more for chargers and the like to use them.  Anything the community gives us will help! We look forward to bringing the FU to the burn as well as the volunteer safety infrastructure!</p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>Hello FUC... Flipizens!  The phone company you love to hate is coming back, and we heard yall want all the phone booths back so we thought about it and decided it was too much work.  But we'll do it anyways knowing we're gonna be on our megaphones yelling at you to pay your damn bills so we'll see you there!</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>My camp will charge the batteries, we have a generator and two backups...  We got this.</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>Please do not climb on the phone booths or set them on fire.</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>In Progress (Making Changes)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>Mostly already created, just minor tweaks to accomodate the new batteries.  I've trained several volunteers how to install the booths at burn and break it down.  We had the 3 we did last year up in an hour or so, I anticipate all 6 this year will go pretty quick as long as daft finishes the effigy in time to put the one on it ;)</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>Been doing FUT since 2015.  This year we arent doing anything larger scale than we've done in the past, we're fixing old stuff and doing it better and faster.  My hope is we've learned to do it so much faster we gain the confidence to expand the payphones next year to provide better safety coverage.  </p>
