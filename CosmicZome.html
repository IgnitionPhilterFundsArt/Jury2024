            <h1>13 - Cosmic Zome</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>The Cosmic Zome is a 13 foot tall, 20 foot diameter, projection-mapped zome.  Unlike traditional geodesic domes which are built out of triangles, a zome is a similar structure built from kite shapes instead of triangles.  This small twist creates a beautiful geometric shape suggesting sacred geometry, with the top of the zome forming the petals of a flower.  The wooden frame will be covered with 84 panels, and multiple projectors inside the zome will create a 360 degree continuous video wall for visitors to enjoy.  Instead of playing traditional motion graphics, the video content will be created from scratch and designed to accentuate the unique geometry of the structure.  Visitors will be invited to sit or lay down and look up at the roof of the structure to relax and get lost in the immersive video and sound experience.  The project is designed to be portable, and to be set up and taken down quickly, allowing it to be transported to events and shared with people across Texas and beyond, starting with Burning Flipside.

Funds will be used to build the structure and buy the necessary audio/visual equipment to realize the project.

The major phases of the project include:
- Design
- Building the frame
- Attaching the panels
- Attaching the projectors
- Creating content for the projectors
- Setup and strike at Flipside 2024

It is designed to be assembled and taken apart quickly for use at Flipside and other regional burns and events.  As everything is firmly attached to the structure, there is minimal risk of MOOP.

As a stretch goal, once the initial graphics pipeline is created, we would like to invite other visual artists to contribute content, time permitting.</p>

            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>Design and planning has been underway since late 2023.  The bulk of the design work will be done at the end of February, and frame construction will start early March.</p>

            <p>$575 plus the $2000 we've raised will allow a scaled back version of the project in the event we cannot secure the remaining funds elsewhere.</p>
