            <h1>13 - Cosmic Zome</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>The Cosmic Zome is a 13 foot tall, 20 foot diameter, projection-mapped zome.  Unlike traditional geodesic domes which are built out of triangles, a zome is a similar structure built from kite shapes instead of triangles.  This small twist creates a beautiful geometric shape suggesting sacred geometry, with the top of the zome forming the petals of a flower.  The wooden frame will be covered with 84 panels, and multiple projectors inside the zome will create a 360 degree continuous video wall for visitors to enjoy.  Instead of playing traditional motion graphics, the video content will be created from scratch and designed to accentuate the unique geometry of the structure.  Visitors will be invited to sit or lay down and look up at the roof of the structure to relax and get lost in the immersive video and sound experience.  The project is designed to be portable, and to be set up and taken down quickly, allowing it to be transported to events and shared with people across Texas and beyond, starting with Burning Flipside.

Funds will be used to build the structure and buy the necessary audio/visual equipment to realize the project.

The major phases of the project include:
- Design
- Building the frame
- Attaching the panels
- Attaching the projectors
- Creating content for the projectors
- Setup and strike at Flipside 2024

It is designed to be assembled and taken apart quickly for use at Flipside and other regional burns and events.  As everything is firmly attached to the structure, there is minimal risk of MOOP.

As a stretch goal, once the initial graphics pipeline is created, we would like to invite other visual artists to contribute content, time permitting.</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>We have a quiet generator to use to power it.</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
            <p>n/a</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>Design and planning has been underway since late 2023.  The bulk of the design work will be done at the end of February, and frame construction will start early March.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>While this is a non-trivial project, we are confident it can be built successfully and on time for Flipside 2024.  

Our camp has attended Burning Flipside and Love Burn twice each (in addition to other smaller events) while providing a full sound camp and visual art experience to attendees.  Our sound and design lead has designed and built much of our camp infrastructure from scratch.  Highlights include a custom 24' wide stage, two 8 foot tall LED towers, an 8 foot by 4 foot LED DJ booth facade, and projection mapping a 16 foot box truck with the camp logo text.

Another key collaborator and camp member is a professional woodworker and has all the needed tools in his shop for building the frame and making the complex cuts required for the project.  Zome construction techniques are widely documented on the web, so there is minimal technical risk in the frame.

We also have numerous camp members available for unskilled labor as needed.

The most complicated aspect of the project is generating video content for 3 different projectors with the proper views to match the layout of the dome.  Our lead's experience in computer graphics, Blender, and GLSL shaders will be essential in realizing the graphics for the project.</p>

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>Total budget is $6600.  We have raised over $2000.  $1000 from Ignition Philter will go a long way to helping us realize the complete vision.</p>

            <h3>AlternativeBudget</h3>
            <p>1000</p>

            <h3>AlternativeBudgetDescription</h3>
            <p>$575 plus the $2000 we've raised will allow a scaled back version of the project in the event we cannot secure the remaining funds elsewhere.</p>
