            <h1>6 - The VOID</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>The VOID is a massive, fancy kaleidoscope. People look in the end of what appears to be a big telescope and experience a spectacular light show of shifting colors and geometric shapes, reflected ad infinitum though vast space that appears to go on forever.

What makes The VOID more intense than a regular kaleidoscope is three things:

1) Size: The body tube is 16 inches in diameter and 6 feet long. You can put your whole face up to it, giving you binocular vision into the illusion.

2) Geometry: Unlike a standard kaleidoscope, the mirrors are set at precise angles that cause tons of internal reflection, giving the impression of a distant, expanding space.

3) Lighting: Also unlike a standard kaleidoscope, one side has shapes etched through the mirror coating and is backlit by controllable LED strips. When this light bounces around the angled mirrors, it appears as infinitely reflected, animated geometric shapes.

The sum total of the above creates an illusion that feels a bit like witnessing the birth of a universe. A spiky starburst shape in the middle of the view flickers and shimmers while waves of colored shapes and light expand from it, washing outwards over the viewer and into infinite space.

From a practial perspective, this will be a large cylindrical object mounted on a wooden frame. Design and installation precautions will be taken to ensure it is robust against wind, rain, and people. It is not intended to be burned; it will be transported in and transported out of the event.

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>February: Design and initial experimentation. March: Fabrication of a 3/4 scale mockup of the essential parts to work out the unknowns and rough edges. April: Fabrication of the bulk of the full-size project, including all internals and structural elements. May: Finishing of the full-size project, including painting and final touches.  Setup and teardown: There is no burnable or moop-y component to this project, the entire thing will be packed in and packed out. The size will require at least two people to install and dismantle it; there are several members of this team and we will ensure that enough people are around to do this.</p>
