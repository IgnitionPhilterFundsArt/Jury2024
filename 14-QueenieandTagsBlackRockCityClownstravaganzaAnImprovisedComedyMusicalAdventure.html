            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>Queenie and Tag’s Black Rock City Clownstravaganza: An Improvised Comedy Musical Adventure will feature clown duo Queenie and Tag riffing off and collaborating with the Flipside crowd to create a completely spontaneous musical pitch on the spot.

The show begins with Queenie and Tag's attempts to sell the audience timeshares on the Pecan Playa. They eventually reveal that their true dream is put up their musical show "MY LEG!" featuring obscure Moby Dick adaptations like "Thar He Blows" and "Glub Glub Glub." But after failing to get funding from the audience to produce the show, they decide to guide the audience through improvising a brand new musical from scratch, to hilarious effect.

Using a mad libs formula onstage, Queenie and Tag elicit suggestions from the raucous attendees to fill in blanks for whimsical story starters like "Once upon a time there was a __" and "Until one day." The topics shouted out by the crowd become the theme, setting, characters, and plot points driving the musical unfolding before them.

Splitting volunteers into singing, dancing, audience, and “barkers”, Queenie and Tag will oversee the on-the-fly creation of lyrics, music, choreography, and song performances based on the crowd's contributions. Two clowns, three once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, and one giant unexpected finale performance - all made up completely on the fly from audience input!

With only the loosest structure and rowdiest Burner energy to work with, Queenie and Tag will tap their quick improv wit and trust in their faithful Burners to spontaneously generate a comedic musical extravaganza pitch that no one, especially the cast and creators, will see coming. It's "Yes And" in its messiest, most unpredictable perfection.

We would love to request funding for this show for elements like costumes, props, music equipment, set pieces, and promotional material to ensure Queenie and Tag’s Black Rock City Clownstravaganza: An Improvised Comedy Musical Adventure can make the biggest comedic splash possible at Flipside 2024!
</p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>

Queenie and Tag’s Black Rock City Clownstravaganza: An Improvised Comedy Musical Adventure turns all your expectations on their heads. This ain't your grandma's musical adventure! After hilariously botched attempts to pitch timeshares and their own wacky Moby Dick musical “MY LEG!”, Queenie and Tag will lead volunteers from the audience through improvising songs, lyrics, dances, and musical styles to co-create an original musical pitch. A country western about jellyfish? A heavy metal opera about lint? With Flipizens steering the ship, ANYTHING is possible!

Volunteers will be split up into singing, dancing, audience, and “barkers” groups as Queenie and Tag oversee the fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants creation of musical magic.

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>Power Needs:
- Battery-powered microphones and portable speaker to amplify vocals and playback music
- Battery-powered string lights for theatrical lighting on the Broadway sign and during numbers
- Battery pack to power any electronics for the pre-show music and whale sound effects
- Batteries for handheld props like squirting flowers

Power Supply:
- A small portable power station will be used to primarily charge and supply continuous power to the microphones, speaker, and lighting during the performances
- Performers will need batteries for individual handheld props, microphones and speaker

Power Conservation:
- The lighting, music and sound amplification needs are relatively low power
- Equipment will be powered off when not in active use to conserve battery
- Queenie and Tag will use vocal projection as much as possible over heavy mic amplification</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>No, the clown musical improv show does not incorporate any flame effects, moveable pieces, or climbable structures.

The only physical elements would be small handheld props like fake harpoons, noisemakers, and simple costume pieces for the performers and audience volunteers. The focus is much more on the live musical performance and audience participation rather than interactive sculpture or installation art.</p>

            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>As transdisciplinary artists with decades of combined experience producing interactive installations and facilitating immersive performances, [clown1 and clown2] are excited to take this show to the next level.

We both have over 4 years of combined participation across the Burner ecosystem, including the Big Burn as well as Flipside, Loveburn, and more regionals. [clown1 and clown2]  have both taught multiple workshops on clown and movement practices, and both perform and create theater productions. We understand the unique creative opportunities and logistical considerations for projects to consider in temporary Burner Cities.

Importantly, we have created many works with similar elements to the proposed Queenie and Tag’s Black Rock City Clownstravaganza: An Improvised Comedy Musical Adventure. For example, [clown1's] show “War and Play”, a nonverbal clown show following a queer clown couple navigating Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, transformed the black box theater spaces through clowning, sensory stimuli, prop manipulation and play, audience interactive activities, and malleable set design. We had a custom-constructed set environment, sourced found objects, incorporated food, and used sound and lighting to play with the audience’s emotional experience of the show. [clown2] was a co-producer and co-creator of the virtual theatrical production The Outlaws of Bremen, which incorporated devised writing processes, blocking, costuming, character work, and live Zoom feedback sessions to engage with the audience.

While Queenie and Tag’s Black Rock City Clownstravaganza: An Improvised Comedy Musical Adventure has more elements we're excited to explore, we can leverage our complementary skill sets for performance, teaching, construction, writing, fabric arts, gathering oddities, lighting design, hosting, and more. As lifelong learners, we welcome any guidance from Ignition Philter on realizing this co-creation. 

We would be honored to manifest the Queenie and Tag’s Black Rock City Clownstravaganza: An Improvised Comedy Musical Adventure for the delight and wonderment of all Flipizens!</p>
