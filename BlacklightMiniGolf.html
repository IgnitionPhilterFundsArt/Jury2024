            <h1>23 - Blacklight Mini Golf</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>Hello jury, thank you so much for your consideration. For my birthday last year I built an entire 9 hole blacklight mini golf course in my backyard by myself. It was an insane amount of work but really beautiful and so incredibly rewarding. Many, many friends played through. Perhaps one of you played through as well? The entire evening I just fantasized about bringing the project to Flipside, only better, and that is what I hope to do. It will be functional every evening from dusk until dawn, assuming it is not raining in which case I would have to put the blacklights away. I love fun. Don't you love fun? Let's play!</p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>Did you forget to leave your competitive side at home? Well, bring your friends and show them who the real winner is. Blacklight mini golf is available every evening from dusk until dawn for your entertainment. Can you beat par?</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>I will use my generator</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Maybe</p>

            <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
            <p>I might have moveable pieces for some of the obstacles in the course but would turn them off when I am not present and observing. I'm also considering some tiki torches if that is allowed?</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>In Progress (Making Changes)

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>The project is already planned, I will start acquiring materials and building it in May. It will be installed during early entry and should come down faster than a theme camp.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I did this project before and it was amazing. I've also participated on many large scale art project builds.</p>
