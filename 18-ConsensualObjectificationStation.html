            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>A mobile interactive experience that allows people to compliment friends and strangers in a familiar but socially discouraged way- by objectifying them! Objectification is normally viewed as dehumanizing since it focuses on one small part of a person at a time, but this art piece seeks to reclaim this experience and allow the objectifier and objectified to connect by allowing the objectification to be viewed as a compliment. This art piece will consist of a pedestal for the consenting human to stand upon to be objectified, a lemonade stand-like structure for the main objectifier to present themselves in (especially handy for when the piece is set up in one location so passers-by can participate), a lit marquee-style arrow to point at the objectified human (which is attached to a wagon so we can easily move the art piece around the city), and a spotlight and megaphone to heighten the objectification experience for those near and far. </p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>Come one, come all! Objectification is the newest compliment- but only if you consent! Join your fellow Flipizens as you objectify your friends new and old at the Consensual Objectification Station! Enter the Objectifying Stand to provide your objectification skills a chance to shine! Climb upon the Pedestal of Objectification and hear what parts of you are beloved by all! Feel free to spotlight your favorite parts of your favorite people as we give compliments to all sorts- by objectifying them! Come become a collection of awesome parts and revel in it! You will never forget your once-in-a-lifetime experience at the Consensual Objectification Station!</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>Gooloo Battery</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>** not provided **</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>Our planning portion of this project is nearly complete, since we have the overall structure and design thought through. We plan to construct most of the art piece in one of the creatorâ€™s shop spaces. Since the piece is mobile, installment is not a concern. It does not have small detachable pieces, nor will it be decorated with any materials that would leave MOOP around our fair city.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>[Artist1] Built the flipside logo pictured with this application with grant money approved in 2022. Designed disco lady mannequins for last year's theme. Did not apply for a grant for that one.
[Artist2] Assisted [Arist1] with building the large lit Flipside logo sign. Was involved with building Tea-Mobile for the Temple of Unity and traveling with it to the big burn in 2018. An undergraduate degree with a focus on technical theater allowed me to gain experience working with multiple materials to build an array of structures and platforms as well. Those projects all went exceedingly well!
[Artist 3]-assisted in building multiple aspects of a larger scale burning man project including a complete rebuild of an RV named "Tea-Mobile" and laser cut paneling for camp entrance and deco. Have assisted in a variety of small scale projects, some of which are pictured below.

            <h3>How much are you asking for?</h3>
            <p>$575</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>$400</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Description</h3>
            <p>Wouldn't be able to have a pedestal, would instead build a small box with a platform on it (think plant stand, but you're the plant). The arrow would need to be smaller and/or would do LED strip light instead of the marquee style light bulbs</p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget Amount</h3>
            <p>$400</p>
