            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>This year’s effigy was specifically designed for accessibility and quick deployment, which would provide participants (weather permitting) with more time to experience the effigy and the effigy field than we have had in previous years. We have a real chance to *play.* We would like to bring this project as an addition to the space, to create an experience across the field that isn’t only beautiful and enjoyable, but continues the idea of rapid deployment and accessibility (as much as we can in an outdoor space).

This project is designed to directly compliment the effigy, however, it is not part of the effigy- it simply extends the footprint and provides additional whimsical spaces for the community to explore.

Cosmic Critter Carnival- imagine the intergalactic traffic jam that these cosmic critters caused on their way to the carnival. Even in space, critters don’t have drivers licenses! They don’t obey stellar traffic laws! Madness ensues, and now some of the UFOs are parked or totaled in epic fashion across the field. There’s occasional hissing, and lights, and led fires, and smoke bellowing from the wreckage. You might see a critter or three trying to get their bearings and yelling on the phone at their insurance company. 

The UFOs, critters, and other physical elements will be fabricated using quarter inch steel rod for the skeletal framework, with painted fabric over the shell (think Chinese Lanterns, but instead of wood and paper, we’re going for metal and fabric). LEDs will be installed in each piece, to capture the glowing “lantern” effect. Minimum 3 “crashed” UFOs will be build, an assortment of critters, and “flaming” (LED) fires dotting the field and firefly lights to add some magic.

These pieces will be designed so that they may be enjoyed by all ages, anytime, day or night.

The dimensions will vary per piece, however, the main UFOs will be 6ft diameter, and about 4ft tall. With multiple lit up pieces, this should help make the effigy field more inviting for participants to play on. 

Prepare to be transported to an intergalactic…crash site!</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>Yes, it has lights and will require power but at this time we are unsure if we will be able to run everything on batteries. If the project requires additional power, we will coordinate with Site Ops and DaFT to see what power is available on the Effigy Field. If there is not any power available, we have a generator we can bring, if needed. </p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>** not provided **</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>We are currently in the planning phase now. We have already sourced the metal we want to use and have the tools to tack weld it together. We have identified several sources for fabrics and LEDs. We intend to begin build the moment we know if there will be available funds for the project.   These pieces are being designed to be modular, so that once we are on site, they will be quickly deployed (once we have permission to set up in the field, once DaFT is done with heavy machinery) and staked into place. Once it’s time for the effigy field to be cleared for burn preparation, we will remove the fasteners and remove them from the field. We should be able to eliminate the possibility of moop, but will of course go through the field once they have been removed to ensure we left the space better than we found it.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>Everyone involved on this level of the project is a repeat arter. 
[Artist1]- Has co-led a number of large scale projects for years, tangible or otherwise (Hydrocarbon Homecoming organization down to the giant metal mums vs Burner Art Safari and various community events). Has worked on several special projects for DaFT over the years, as well as generally supporting that team. Recently disco plated a whole toilet, which certainly says something about determination or something. 
[Artist2]- His portfolio includes many of the fire art projects that have been mounted on or near recent Flipside and Freezerburn effigies, including Pyropod and Cloudseeder (Ignition Philter 2018 and 2023 art grants).
