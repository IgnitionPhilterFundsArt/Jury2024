            <h1>14 - Queenie and Tag�s Black Rock City Clownstravaganza: An Improvised Comedy Musical Adventure</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>Queenie and Tag"s Black Rock City Clownstravaganza: An Improvised Comedy Musical Adventure will feature clown duo Queenie and Tag riffing off and collaborating with the Flipside crowd to create a completely spontaneous musical pitch on the spot.

The show begins with Queenie and Tag's attempts to sell the audience timeshares on the Pecan Playa. They eventually reveal that their true dream is put up their musical show "MY LEG!" featuring obscure Moby Dick adaptations like "Thar He Blows" and "Glub Glub Glub." But after failing to get funding from the audience to produce the show, they decide to guide the audience through improvising a brand new musical from scratch, to hilarious effect.

Using a mad libs formula onstage, Queenie and Tag elicit suggestions from the raucous attendees to fill in blanks for whimsical story starters like "Once upon a time there was a __" and "Until one day." The topics shouted out by the crowd become the theme, setting, characters, and plot points driving the musical unfolding before them.

Splitting volunteers into singing, dancing, audience, and "barkers", Queenie and Tag will oversee the on-the-fly creation of lyrics, music, choreography, and song performances based on the crowd's contributions. Two clowns, three once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, and one giant unexpected finale performance - all made up completely on the fly from audience input!

With only the loosest structure and rowdiest Burner energy to work with, Queenie and Tag will tap their quick improv wit and trust in their faithful Burners to spontaneously generate a comedic musical extravaganza pitch that no one, especially the cast and creators, will see coming. It's "Yes And" in its messiest, most unpredictable perfection.

We would love to request funding for this show for elements like costumes, props, music equipment, set pieces, and promotional material to ensure Queenie and Tag"s Black Rock City Clownstravaganza: An Improvised Comedy Musical Adventure can make the biggest comedic splash possible at Flipside 2024!
</p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>

Queenie and Tag"s Black Rock City Clownstravaganza: An Improvised Comedy Musical Adventure turns all your expectations on their heads. This ain't your grandma's musical adventure!

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>Power Needs:
- Battery-powered microphones and portable speaker to amplify vocals and playback music
- Battery-powered string lights for theatrical lighting on the Broadway sign and during numbers
- Battery pack to power any electronics for the pre-show music and whale sound effects
- Batteries for handheld props like squirting flowers

Power Supply:
- A small portable power station will be used to primarily charge and supply continuous power to the microphones, speaker, and lighting during the performances
- Performers will need batteries for individual handheld props, microphones and speaker

Power Conservation:
- The lighting, music and sound amplification needs are relatively low power
- Equipment will be powered off when not in active use to conserve battery
- Queenie and Tag will use vocal projection as much as possible over heavy mic amplification</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
            <p>No, the clown musical improv show does not incorporate any flame effects, moveable pieces, or climbable structures.

The only physical elements would be small handheld props like fake harpoons, noisemakers, and simple costume pieces for the performers and audience volunteers. The focus is much more on the live musical performance and audience participation rather than interactive sculpture or installation art.</p>
