            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>"Dr. Algebrax"s mind meld device is a multi-layered invention. First, it soaks up the energy of wanderers and passersby. Next, it captures their life essence as they become captivated by the spinning blades, optical illusions, and mind meld magic. As more onlookers become entranced, the strength of the mind meld grows. Until eventually, all thoughts other than "I hate carnivals" dissipate entirely for everyone participating in the Mind-Meld.Thus will Dr. Algebrax"s work be completed - by the power of the Eternal Vortex.

""Eternal Vortex: The Illusion of Infinity"" invites viewers to contemplate the nature of perception and the concept of infinity. By harnessing the power of optical illusion the artwork creates a space where boundaries dissolve and the mind is free to wander through endless realms of possibility.

The central element of the artwork is a sleek, minimalist ceiling fan, positioned in the center of the dome. The fan blades, however, are not ordinary; they include meticulously crafted colors and patterns on each blade. When in motion, the colors and patterns create an optical illusion. The hypnotic motion of the fan blades and the ever-changing patterns of light and shadow evoke a sense of wonder and awe, prompting viewers to question their perceptions of space, time, and reality.

The illusion of infinity is further enhanced by the use of mirrored acrylic to reflect the light within the fixture. The result is a breathtaking visual spectacle that envelops viewers in a vortex of shimmering light and shadow, blurring the boundaries between reality and illusion. The entire spectacle serves as a metaphor for the boundless potential of the human imagination and the infinite mysteries of the universe.

Through its immersive experience, ""Eternal Vortex"" encourages viewers to explore the interconnectedness of art, science, and philosophy, inviting them to engage with the artwork on both a visual and intellectual level. Whether mesmerized by the beauty of the illusion or intrigued by its philosophical implications, viewers are sure to be transported to a realm where the possibilities are truly endless.

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>Production of the piece will take place in late march/early april. The installation on site should take less than an hour and will be dismantled at the end of the event and stored. </p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I have worked on varies projects through the years for burn events and festivals. Most recently I received an art grant for Flipside 2022 for "Cosmic Fluorescence" an wood and paint 13ft sculpture. The project was very well received by the community and then traveled to varies other events in 2022. In 2022 and 2023 I was part of the team that installed "the HoneyComb Dome" interactive art piece for Utopiafest. This piece grew and changed over the many installations. It consists of multiple dome structures with interactive art in the center and spaces for people to hang out within the art. In 2024, I assisted campmates in the production and execution of "Pyre of the Cosmos" for Freezerburn. The piece was an 8 ft long eye. The frame was made of chicken wire and covered in wool with a fire element for the iris. </p>
