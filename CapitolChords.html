            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>Taking the form of a colossal guitar, the sculpture "Capitol Chords"is a testament to Austin's renowned status as the live music capital of the world. Crafted using intricate color-staining techniques, the guitar's surface is adorned with beautiful, swirling designs that capture the essence of the city's artistic spirit and is covered with photographs of local murals. The carvings on the base of the sculpture depict some serious issues, serving as a commentary on the city's role as the capital of Texas as well as a magnificent tribute to the city's vibrant cultural tapestry. Three of the walls will be the works of talented local artists, while one will be a communal mural painted by Austin burners reflecting their personal relationship to this amazing city. True to Austin's motto of "Keep Austin Weird," the inside of the base becomes a curated space reflecting the eccentric and eclectic nature of the city, set to music playing softly in the background. Amongst the remarkable works by local artists, there are models of effigies from past Flipsides and Freezerburns showcasing the rich history of the Austin burner community. At night, the sculpture comes alive with a dazzling display of bright lights, illuminating the intricate details. The guitar becomes a beacon, sparkling in the darkness and symbolizing the city's pulsating energy. To make the sculpture even more remarkable, the merry-go-round positioned beneath is connected to the two hands on the guitar. As the  merry-go-round turns the right hand begins strumming the strings while the left moves up and down the deck as if taking one chord after another creating a dynamic and engaging experience for onlookers and participants.</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
            <p>This installation does not incorporate flame effects and is not climbable, however it contains moving pieces activated by the nearby merry-go-round. All moving parts are at least 9� off the ground and outside people�s reach. </p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>Design has been finalized and we are now working on details. The build will commence as soon as we receive funds for materials. All pieces will be pre-cut, sanded and painted as needed, pre-assembled in large sections, and checked to ensure they fit together during the pre-Flipside build. We expect to need 2-3 build days on the land before opening it to visitors. We expect to need 1.5 days to carefully disassemble and transport off the property. Project will bring moop-buckets and moop-sticks to be used for daily de-mooping, as well as for post event cleanup.</p>
