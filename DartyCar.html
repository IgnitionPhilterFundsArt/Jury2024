            <h1>Darty Car</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>"Darty Car" (short for day-party car) is a modified go-cart with drinks, umbrellas, music, misters and DAYTIME ENERGY. "But why is it on a go-kart??" - great question! Darty car is meant to bring the party all around flipside! We want to use our art car as a tool to help highlight the smaller parts of Flipside. Darty car will be parking at locations around Flipside to draw crowds and supply all the resources to party in the daylight! Like the ice cream truck in childhood, we hope flipizens will see the Darty Car and come running from their camps to join their neighbors exploring Flipside, connecting each other, while sipping on a cold drink. </p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>Darty Car (Day-Party Car) is preparing for its Flipside Debut! Darty Car is a comically small mutant vehicle equipped with everything you need to survive the heat and PARTY. Ice cold drinks, music, shade from the sun, misters, endless entertainment, ALL DELIVERED TO A LOCATION NEAR YOU. We plan to use or mobile capabilities to highlight some of the far corners of flipside in the daytime - hear the sirens call and discover new art, camps, or "that cool tree over there" with Darty Car by your side!</p>

            <h3>Application Art</h3>
            <p>** not provided **</p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>The cart is gasoline powered, we will bring!</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
            <p>Technically the art car itself is �movable�, but the cart is simply used to move the party supplies - it is NOT a public vehicle to get inside of, and we will be taking the key when parked to ensure participants do not feel inspired to take a joy ride. </p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>We plan to secure the base vehicle and do necessary mechanical work in March, modify the vehicle in April, and then final touches in May before Flipside! We will be taking the vehicle in a truck to and from the event. </p>
