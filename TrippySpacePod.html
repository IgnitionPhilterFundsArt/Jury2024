            <h1>10 - Trippy Space Pod</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>We want to build a room with light up cosmic/trippy shower curtains that will be on theme for cosmic critter carnival. This will be a 6ftx6ftx8ft room. The room will be built out of 2x3 lumber with shower curtains on the inside and outside walls with led light strips between the walls and ceiling. We would like for this to be an open use space that can be placed anywhere at flipside due to only needing a battery power supply station. If funds allow, we would like for this to be a comfy lounge space to relax and enjoy the celestial show.</p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>The Trippy Space Pod will be a cozy space to relax and enjoy the walls changing colors around you creating a visual experience. The pod will immerse you into the cosmos in this light up space. Come hang out for a minute or all day and enjoy this out of the world experience. </p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>Just battery power will be required and is included in the excel sheet of expenses. </p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>The frames of the walls will be built prior to flipside. We will request early entry to then install on site at really in a remote location (away from a lot of light). We would love for this to be out in the playa for everyone to enjoy. We will attach walls, shower curtains, black plastic, and lights on site during early entry (or even the weekend prior). The project will be taken down monday during exodus.</p>
