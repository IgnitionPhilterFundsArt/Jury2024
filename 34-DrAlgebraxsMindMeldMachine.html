            <h1>34 - Dr. Algebrax's Mind-Meld Machine</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>"Dr. Algebrax’s Mind-Meld Machine is a 20' geodesic dome adorned with a luminescent macramé cover. The dome acts as its own stand-alone piece, but additionally serves as a curated gallery space for three other collaborative installations.

By literally weaving together traditional fiber-art and “current” technology, this piece presents a juxtaposition of past and present craft culture, and breaks down notions of what modern sculpture at festivals is “supposed” to be.

Additionally, our piece acts as a metaphor for connectedness, a literal net that intertwines multiple installations, while providing an open space for critters from all sectors of the solar system to come together and meld minds.

During the day this piece will provide participants with a comfortable and shaded communal space to interact with and interpret multiple sculptural installations, while at night creating a cascading phenomenon of illuminated fiber-optic latticework; thus creating Dr. Algebrax’s Mind-Melding Machine."</p>

            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p> Yes, I have been a part of several, but most recent are my two installations include: 

The Honeycomb Dome
Every year I build a 20' geodesic dome at Utopia Fest called The Honeycomb Dome, each year we add and adapt pieces inside the dome. 

Pyre of the Cosmos
Last January our camp at Freezerburn built a dome with a giant eye and fire ceiling.

I have pictures of The Honeycomb Dome from every year I have been doing it (I think 12 years?). And I also have a few of the Pyre.
