            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>For the last couple of years I have been wanting to make a laminar flow fountain but have always set it off to the side. It is a good thing too because I have come up with additional elements that will make it even more interesting. The elements I want to incorporate are fire and light. 
So let's start first with what defining laminar flow. It is a flow in which the fluid travels smoothly or in regular paths, in contrast to turbulent flow, in which the fluid undergoes irregular fluctuations and mixing. In laminar flow, the velocity, pressure, and other flow properties at each point in the fluid remain constant. 
Ok ok in easier to understand terms basically a turbulent flow is what would come out of a garden hose if you held your finger over the end. It might flow in one direction but is likely to flow several directions. Laminar flow is the opposite in that the water comes out in a crystal clear stream that almost looks like a perfect tube. 
Within the laminar flow of water, I am going to add propane to the mix to add the fire element. 
The third element, light, will be added and visible within the laminar water flow. Since the water is laminar the light travels well along the path. </p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>The laminar fountain is captivating with elements of water, light, and fire. </p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>Camp has power and I have a small generator as backup.</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>The flame portion will use a low pressure regulator (max 2psi) and incorporate multiple cut off points. I will also have a fire extinguisher whenever the propane portion is lit. The propane will only be lit when the effect is supervised. Otherwise it can run on it's own with just the lighting.</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>As soon as funding is available I will gather the more expensive items (light source, fiberoptic cable, pump, propane fittings). Build time is anticipated to be 2-3 weeks including testing. Installation on-site should take less than an hour. The project will be packed up and removed and will not leave any trace. </p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I have done several projects for Flipside over the last few years. The projects were challenging at times but that has helped me with planning and execution. Each project has been different than the last but it helps keep me excited about what I am creating and sharing with others.  Past works include: Giant light bright (8ft x 8ft), Painting with UV light (led flashlights and led lasers were the 'brushes'), Roomba battle/bowling/general shenanigans, and large LED Disco Balls. </p>

            <h3>Alternative Budget</h3>
            <p>I would remove the propane and propane accessories from the build ;)</p>
