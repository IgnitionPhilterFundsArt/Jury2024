            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>"Pretty Penta-Pussies : A Surreal Seascape" invites viewers to embark on a journey of imagination and wonder, exploring the hidden depths of the ocean and the mysteries of the subconscious mind. Through its playful combination of inflatable sculptures and interactive elements, the artwork celebrates the beauty and diversity of marine life while also encouraging reflection on the fragility of our natural environment.
The inflatable tentacles serve as a focal point, drawing viewers into the immersive world of the overall installation and inviting them to engage with their surroundings in new and unexpected ways. By transforming the gallery space into a surreal seascape, the artwork challenges conventional notions of reality and invites viewers to reconsider their relationship with the world around them.

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>"Pretty Penta-Pussies : A Surreal Seascape"" is an immersive installation art piece that transports viewers into a whimsical underwater world. Five towering inflatable tentacles, each pulsating with vibrant colors and intricate patterns, stand at the center of the exhibition space.
Rising from the ground like giant cephalopod creatures, the inflatable tentacles sway gently in the air, evoking the graceful movement of sea anemones and jellyfish. The tentacles are crafted from translucent materials, allowing light to filter through and illuminate the space with a soft, ethereal glow.
The inflatable tentacles respond to the slightest breeze, undulating and swaying in a hypnotic dance that captivates the senses and blurs the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
It all began one sunny day, when a powerful current swept through the ocean, carrying Pearl the Penta-Pussy far from her home reef. Suddenly, a gust of wind raised her up - up out of the water! To her surprise, she discovered that she could control her movements in the air. Plagued by thoughts of home, she curled into a ball and began her descent. She landed on top of one Dr. Algebrax, who was rudely awoken from their slumber. Eventually, Dr. Algebrax welcomed Pearl the Penta-pussy into Casbah. She slowly unraveled her five arms and used her pussuckers to feel around for an inviting surface. As she climbed the mind-meld dome, she felt the vibrations she had been missing her whole life, and she  finally felt a sense of home.
Inspired by my own journey.

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>It is an inflatable and if any lights need plugs we can easily run the cords to one of our camp generators at no cost to you.</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
            <p>Nope</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>In Progress (Making Changes)

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>The project will be set up with our many campmates who usually receive early entry through their volunteer squads. The project will be maintained throughout the event by our cru and taken down together at Exodus. </p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I build large domes and provide art installations for UtopiaFest, I completed a large pannel of 3D art with a 3D anotomical heart protruding from a canvas at Flipside 2020 and burned it with the rest of the effigy, and my sister had a pannel of dancers right below mine (I made sure mine was on top of hers due to sister rivalries). I earned a grant for my Barrel of Monkeys from Engulf in 2023 and I'll be bringing it to Flipside for the carnival as well. I also made Jellyfish art for Burnt Soup and painted some glow in the dark bycicles I can't wait to take to Flipside again. 

I'm going to make sure this project is completed in time. It's very important to me and my campmates. </p>
