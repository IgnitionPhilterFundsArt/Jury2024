            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>Picture a large (8ft x 6ft) Celtic Knot, with two hearts, symbolizing love, unity and interconnectedness. It is suspended in the air. The Celtic Love Knot is made from fake neon, individually addressable, LED strips. The LEDs give off an memorizing warm glow in the distance.

As participants approach the sculpture, they see a pedestal with two big buttons. One button that “stores love” for future use titled “Send Love” and another button titled “Receive Love” that dispenses stored love. When a participant presses either button, a flowing pattern will be displayed from the LEDs in the form of the knot. The pattern displayed will be one of many random possibilities. Sending and receiving will each have a distinct vibe for the pattern.

The main portion of this project already exists, as it was displayed at Myschievia this past year.
I would like to apply for a grant to bring this project to Flipside and make some upgrades that will enhance the interactivity of the art piece and make setup easier.

There are 2 main upgrades I’d like to do.The first would be an engraved instruction plaque that describes the art’s inspiration and the differences between the ”Send Love” and “Receive Love” buttons.  The second upgrade is adding the logo of the piece to the button stand. The logo will have back lighting provided by individually addressable LEDs.

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>Glowing Heartweave is a large interactive LED art installation. Come interact with the art piece from dusk until dawn by storing love for a future flipcitizen or withdrawing some of the universe’s stored love.</p>

            <h3>Application Art</h3>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>Yes, I have a small generator that powers the art piece.</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>No flame effects or moving pieces and the art is not climbable.</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>In Progress (Making Changes)

            <h3>Time Line</h3>
            <p>March: Finalize design of pedestal, buy materials, project work area setup April: Cut CNC router parts, design lighting layouts, assemble pedestal, start wiring LEDs May 1 - 11: Finalize LED wiring,  program new patterns, May 11: Test run of new pedestal and main LED segments May 11 - 23: Final fixing of any issues  Setup Plans: Pending early entry approval, I’d like to set up the project on the Wednesday of the event. It takes me a good chunk of time to get everything put together and working. It will be possible to have everything in place and working by Thursday night.  After setup, the art piece will be active from dusk until dawn every night.  Teardown: Tear down is much easier, on Monday morning my camp will assist with the removal and packing of the art piece. After we have everything removed from the area, we will do a leave no trace sweep to ensure that we leave the land clean.</p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I’ve made and brought three larger art pieces to regional burns over the past few years. My first art piece that I brought was “I Love You” which was a glowing neon sign with the text “I love you”. This sign was mounted to a wooden frame and hung in the air. “I Love You” was brought to Flipside, Burnt Soup, Myschievia and Transformus over the course of a few years.

My second larger piece is “Rick, the Pineapple'' which is a 7ft tall by 4ft wide wooden pineapple with a unique pattern that is lined with individually addressable LED’s. Rick has around 15 different patterns. Rick has been to Flipside, Myschievia and Transformus.

My most recent piece is “Glowing Heartweave” which I’ve described above, I brought “Glowing Heartweave” out to Myschievia in 2023. The first outing of this piece went well and though it was functional for the duration of the event, there are several improvements that I’d like to make.
