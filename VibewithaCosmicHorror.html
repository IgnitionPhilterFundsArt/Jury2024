            <h1>27 - Vibe with a Cosmic Horror</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>The central sculpture of this project is a deer-like cosmic creature made primarily of weaved willow branches and scavenged bones, rocks, lichen, cactus skeletons, etc, taken from around Texas with permission. Around the creature I will begin placing stones in interesting patterns. Many stones, leaves, and other objects will be available in some sort of bin for participants to use themselves to finish the patterns or start their own shrines/rock stacks/patterns, along with a sign by the materials bin explaining their purpose.</p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>Vibe with (or be unsettled by!) a Cosmic Creature - an old god, a cosmic horror, a friendo - whatever you find in this particular conglomeration of willow branches, bones, and lichen. The Creature has graciously brought with them the most interesting of stones and other objects for you to use to craft shrines, patterns, and offerings for them. </p>

            <h3>Does it Need Power</h3>
            <p>Maybe</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>I have an electric generator that can be used, or probably other generators I may be able to borrow. Otherwise, I'm looking at battery powered and/or solar lights</p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>No</p>

            <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
            <p>** not provided **</p>

            <h3>Piece Already Exist or In Progress</h3>
            <p>Proposed Concept (Not Yet)

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>The main sculpture itself will be created fairly quickly - willow only remains pliable for about a week after rehydrating, so the slow part is just waiting for it to arrive. Most other parts of the project I have already collected and just needs to be assembled. I believe installation and removal of the piece will be quick on the first and last day of FS.   </p>

           
            <h3>Completed Past Projects?</h3>
            <p>I made a smaller sculpture similar to the one I plan for this project for Artic Expedition back in 2021, so I have some familiarity with the materials and process.</p>
